I'm Megan, a first-year astrophysics Ph.D student at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.physics.upenn.edu/). My main focus is cosmology, and I'm currently interested in theoretical aspects of the early universe.\
\
I graduated from the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/en) in 2024 with a B.S. in astrophysics and a minor in theatre and performance studies. As an undergrad, I was interested in using machine learning to explore cosmological questions and worked on three different research projects. You can check them out under the [research tab](https://meganzyf.github.io/research).\
\
Outside of research, I'm passionate about STEM [outreach](https://meganzyf.github.io/outreach) and theatre (both as an audience and as a [creator](https://taps.uchicago.edu/news-events/events/ba-projects)).
