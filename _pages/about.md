I'm Megan, a first-year astrophysics Ph.D student at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.physics.upenn.edu/). My main interest is cosmology, and I'm currently transitioning to more theoretical work on the early universe.\
\
I graduated from UChicago in 2024 with a B.S. in astrophysics and a minor in theatre and performance studies. I was interested in using machine learning to explore cosmological questions and worked on three different research projects as an undergrad. You can check them out under the [research tab](https://meganzyf.github.io/research).\
\
Outside of research, I'm passionate about STEM [outreach](https://meganzyf.github.io/outreach) and theatre (both as an audience and as a [creator](https://taps.uchicago.edu/news-events/events/ba-projects)).
