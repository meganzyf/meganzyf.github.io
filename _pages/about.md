I'm Megan, an incoming astrophysics Ph.D student at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.physics.upenn.edu/). I'm interested in various questions in cosmology and using machine-learning to explore these questions.\
I graduated from UChicago in 2024 with a B.S. in astrophysics and a minor in theatre and performance studies. I worked on three different research projects as an undergrad. You can check them out under the [research tab](https://meganzyf.github.io/research).\
Outside of research, I'm passionate about STEM [outreach](https://meganzyf.github.io/outreach) and the performing arts (both as an audience and as a [creator](https://taps.uchicago.edu/news-events/events/ba-projects)).
