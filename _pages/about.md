I'm Megan, an incoming astrophysics Ph.D student at the University of Pennsylvania. I'm interested in various questions in cosmology and using machine-learning to explore these questions.\
I graduated from UChicago in 2024 with a B.S. in astrophysics (with honors) and a minor in theater. You can check out my undergraduate research projects under the [research tab](https://meganzyf.github.io/research). I have also been involved with STEM [outreach](https://meganzyf.github.io/outreach) as an undergrad.
