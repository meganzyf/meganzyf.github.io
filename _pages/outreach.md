During my time at UChicago, I have been heavily involved with building communities for minorities in STEM. These communities have helped me battle the lack of belonging I sometimes feel as a woman in a male-dominated field, and I hope to continue these efforts in graduate school.\
As a board member of the [Society of Women in Physics (SWiP)](https://uchicagoswip.weebly.com/about.html), I have helped organize mentorship events, speaker talks, and research panels, as well as maintaining the official SWiP website and Instagram page. I was also part of the [Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers (SASE)](https://www.instagram.com/sase_uchicago/), where I organized social events for the Asian science community on campus. In my first year, I was part of the [Society of Women Engineers (SWE)](https://blueprint.uchicago.edu/organization/swe).
