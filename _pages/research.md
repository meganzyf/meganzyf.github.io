## Undergrad Research Projects ##
### Honors Thesis: Convolutional Neural Network for Type Ia Supernova Distance Estimation ###
*advised by Prof. [Joshua Frieman](https://astrophysics.uchicago.edu/people/profile/joshua-a.-frieman/) & Prof. [Rick Kessler](https://astrophysics.uchicago.edu/people/profile/richard-kessler/)
at UChicago*\
My honors thesis project aimed to develop photometric data based Type Ia Supernova (SNe Ia) distance estimators by using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Our algorithm can predict SNe Ia distance and redshift from multi-band lightcurves. We applied our model to simulated LSST data, which are processed through a 2D Gaussian Process (GP) to create two-dimensional image representations of the lightcurves. We achieved satisfactory but limited accuracy when predicting both the distance and the redshift.\

### Observation and Analysis of wide-separation lensed quasars ###
*[COOL-LAMPS collaboration](https://coollamps.github.io/), advised by Prof. [Michael Gladders](https://astrophysics.uchicago.edu/people/profile/michael-d.-gladders/) at UChicago*\
Wide-separation lensed quasars (WSLQs) are extremely rare but offer unique astrophysical insights due to their enlarged time delays and image separations. In this project, I observed potential WSLQ targets using the Magellan Telescope, performed spectral energy distribution fittings on the obtained data, and conducted GALFIT modeling on the observed and historical data. Together with others in COOL-LAMPS, we observed the 7th WSLQ to date. 

### Domain Adaptation for Measurements of Strong Gravitational Lenses ###
*advised by Dr. [Brian Nord](http://briandnord.com/bio) & Dr. [Aleksandra Ciprijanovic](https://aleksandraciprijanovic.wordpress.com/) at Fermilab*\
This project applied machine learning to strong gravitational lensing. We aimed to address the problem of poor performance of data analysis algorithms trained on simulated data when applied to real data. To this end, we employed domain adaptation (DA), which is an ML technique that can solve the issue by finding common features in simulated and real data. I developed algorithms using a DA technique called Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) for simulated strong lenses and Dark Energy Survey (DES) - like lenses (i.e., imitations of actual lenses). Our results demonstrated that the algorithm performance improves by 90% when asked to estimate the Einstein radius on the DES-like dataset.\
